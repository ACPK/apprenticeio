          <div class="hr"></div>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://hoptoadapp.com">Hoptoad</a> web application is a service for web developers and their managers to gather performance metrics and analyze trends for the web application they develop and maintain. The service is a centralized error aggregator for web sites where developers can review the errors being encountered by people who are using their website; triage these errors; and watch over time as the error count goes down. Hoptoad improves upon previous solutions to this problem with our unique “duplicate detection” algorithm, which keeps email traffic to a bare minimum and puts developers in front of the only information they actually care about.

          <h3>Umbrella Today</h3>
          <div class="hr"></div>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://umbrellatoday.com">Umbrella Today</a> application is the simplest weather report a person could possibly want. We were frustrated with the constant information overload provided by web and television-based weather reporting services, so we attempted to build a service that answered the one question anyone really cares about — “do I need to bring an umbrella?” The Umbrella Today application was conceived, designed, developed and continues to be maintained entirely by thoughtbot. The codebase for the project is used as subject material for our Ruby on Rails training courses.
