    <h2>We make web apps for startups &amp; businesses</h2>

    <section>
      <p>We are a full-service team of web designers and developers (we don't hire sub-contractors, everyone works here fulltime). We have focused only on Ruby on Rails web applications since before Rails 1.0 was released in 2005.</p>
      <p>Our process is to design the user interface first, then implement user stories. We work in weekly iterations and deploy to production often. We believe our process maximizes product quality and flexibility of scope right up until launch.</p>
      <p>Learn more about our process in our client handbook.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>thoughtbot is the best in the industry as far as Ruby on Rails programming/developers. We're very pleased with the product they created for us and would recommend them to anyone looking to build a web application in Ruby.</p>
