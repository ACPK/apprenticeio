        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Iora Health is a healthcare provider trying to redefine primary care in a way that empowers patients to manage their own health. In support of this new system &mdash; where traditional pen and paper fall short and current software solutions implement the old healthcare model &mdash; Iora needed to start from scratch with a completely custom software platform.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="solution">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>We started our engagement with Iora Health by taking a deep dive into the details of their new healthcare model.  Our aim was to gather an exhaustive understanding of the process, requirements, and technology needed to provide the most innovative health care management software.</p>
        <p>Working together, we designed a transformative medical records system.  In this system, patient records are managed electronically and updated on-the-fly for instantaneous communication between Iora's internal team of health care specialists.</p>
        <p>The system was built in a way that enables both traditional desktop access as well as a newer tablet model.  Healthcare workers can use iPads to update medical records, take notes, and delegate tasks while working directly with patients.</p>
