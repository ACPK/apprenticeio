          You've built and deployed least one Rails app, and you are able to
          work effectively in Rails, including performing TDD, but have more to
          learn. Or, you have extensive experience with Ruby on Rails, but have
          little experience with test-driven development or Rails best

          <strong>Designer.</strong>
          You have solid visual design skills, and your self-hosted web
          portfolio showcases your knowledge of HTML and CSS. You have strong
          opinions and perspectives about product design. In other words, you
          have the raw materials and trainability to do <%= link_to 'this job',
