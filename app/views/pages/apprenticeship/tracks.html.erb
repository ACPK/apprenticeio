          <strong>Developer.</strong>
          You've built at least one Rails app, and have gone through the Rails
          Tutorial. You feel comfortable in Ruby, but may have less experience with
          Rails. Or, you have extensive experience with Ruby on Rails but have
          little experience with test-driven development or Rails best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Designer.</strong>
          You've got a solid visual design portfolio, but you may not be comfortable
          with designing for the web, or front-end development with HTML and CSS.
          You're exactly who we want!
