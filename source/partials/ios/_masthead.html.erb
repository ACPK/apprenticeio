    Our expectations for apprentice iOS developers
  </h2>
  <p>
    At the end of three months, we expect iOS developer apprentices at
    thoughtbot to fill the role of a full iOS developer.  This means being very
    experienced with building and shipping iOS applications, in Swift, doing
    test-driven development along the way.
