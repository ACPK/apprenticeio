    Our expectations for apprentice web&nbsp;developers
  </h2>
  <p>
    At the end of three months, we expect developer apprentices at thoughtbot to
    fill the role of a full web developer.  This means being very experienced
    with building and shipping Rails &amp; JavaScript applications, doing fully
    test-driven development along the way.
