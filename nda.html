  <h2>We don't require NDAs with our clients, but we're comfortable signing them.</h2>

  <p>If you believe that we will need a Non-disclosure agreement in place prior to an initial call, you can download and complete ours and email it back to <a href="mailto:info@thoughtbot.com">info@thoughtbot.com</a> or fax it to 866-217-5992.</p>

  <p>We have a policy of not working for two clients at the same time who are in potentially competing businesses.  We will hold to this policy regardless of whether we have entered into an NDA with your business or not.  We will also identify any conflict of interest along those lines as soon as we become aware of it.</p>
  <p>Thank you for considering thoughtbot.</p>
