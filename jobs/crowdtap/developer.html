      <li>
        <p>We (thoughtbot) have been working with Crowdtap for more than a year. We led the development of their initial MVP and worked with their in-house team doing regular weekly iterations for over a year. The main engagement ended in April, but we continue to be involved in the team and taking on special projects.</p>

        <p>We happily recommend them to fellow web developers and strongly encourage you to apply.</p>

        <p>The application <strong>primarily uses MongoDB</strong> as its data store and Crowdtap continues to push best-practices in testing and application architectire.</p>

        <p>Crowdtap is looking for both senior and less experienced developers to join their team.</p>

        <p>Regardless of your prior experience, you will design, build and test the core components of the platform, working directly with the product and business development teams to improve and extend their awesome product, continuously refactor the code base to ensure it is maintainable, and practice <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong> like nobody's business.</p>
