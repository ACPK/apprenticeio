    <h2>Work with us</h2>
    <p>thoughtbot is a small software development and consulting company located in Boston, MA and founded in 2003. The majority of clients we work with are founders of early-stage startups who we help build the smallest thing possible, get it to launch, and iterate from there. We also have <a href="/#products">our own products</a> and <a href="/community">open source contributions</a>.</p>

      <li><a href="/jobs/apprentice">Apprentice</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Work with our clients</h2>
    <p>In the best-case scenario, at the end of our engagement with clients, they are financially stable, have a Rails application written and deployed to our standards, and are hiring their own world-class design and development team. For anyone who wants to work at a promising early-stage product startup, consider these jobs.</p>
