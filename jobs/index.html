    <section class="about-thoughtbot">
    <p class="intro">thoughtbot is a small software development and consulting company located in Boston, MA and founded in 2003. The majority of clients we work with are founders of early-stage startups who we help build the smallest thing possible, get it to launch, and iterate from there. We also have <a href="/#products">our own products</a> and <a href="/community">open source contributions</a>.</p>

  <div>
    <p>We are founded and built by developers and designers. We are profitable and don't have any outside investors. Therefore our primary motivation is to create a small, expert team of developers and designers who love doing what they do in the way they do it. We believe that the success of our clients, the quality of our products and our code will excel given the foundation of an enjoyable place to work in the way that designers and developers want.</p>

    <p>If you're thinking about working with us you might be interested in reading more about our philosophies and process in our <a href="http://playbook.thoughtbot.com">playbook</a>.</p>
