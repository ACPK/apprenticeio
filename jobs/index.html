    <h3>More about us</h3>
    <p>We are founded and built by developers and designers. We are profitable and don't have any outside investors. Therefore our primary motivation is to create a small, expert team of developers and designers who love doing what they do in the way they do it. We believe that the success of our clients, the quality of our products and our code will excel given the foundation of an enjoyable place to work in the way that designers and developers want.</p>
    <p>Driven by that desire, we have a way of doing certain things that makes us different from other places you might work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We do not employ sales people or project managers.</strong> We believe that for the kinds of projects and clients we work with sales people and project managers simply get in the way. Instead, we choose to focus our energy on building a great team of designers and developers who work directly with customers.</li>
      <li><strong>We work at a sustainable pace.</strong> We limit work to 40 hours per week because we believe that anyone working 12 hour days will not be doing their best work. We believe that its better to have an open, honest relationship with our customers about what is feasible, rather than working unsustainably to hit an artibrary and unrealistic deadline. [<a href="http://handbook.thoughtbot.com/rhythm/sustainable-pace/">Read more</a>]</li>
      <li><strong>On day one, you are given the agency to make thoughtbot better.</strong> Our entire advancement and reward structure is predicated on the idea that doing good work on client projects is the base level of expectation. You are rewarded for exceeding those expectations by instigating change in the way we do things, launching new products and open source projects, and accomplishing things that we didn't even think to list here.</li>
    </ul>
