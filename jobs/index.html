    <h2>Current Openings</h2>
    <p>thoughtbot is a small software development and consulting company located in Boston, MA and founded in 2003. The majority of clients we work with are founders of early-stage startups who we help build the smallest thing possible, get it to launch, and iterate from there. We also have <a href="/#products">our own products</a> and <a href="/community">open source contributions</a>.</p>
