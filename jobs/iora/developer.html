    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>We (thoughtbot) have been working with Iora for the past few months and the engagement ends in September. We're big fans of this company and the people who work there.</p>

        <p>We happily recommend them to fellow web developers and strongly encourage you to apply.</p>

        <p>As a member of their full-time, five-person engineering team, you'll <strong>work with developers who are passionate</strong> about ensuring the delivery of high quality software using best practices. This is a test-driven development, Cucumber-and-RSpec, "CI is green" kind of team.</p>

        <p>Together, we've built a modern Ruby-based architecture. There's a Rails 3 application at the heart of the system and the team expects small, focused Ruby web services will be built to interact with the main app to handle some interesting data feeds.</p>

        <p>The app is inherently mobile. It's <strong>designed for the iPad</strong>, with a doctor's touch in mind. Forget about IE6. Anything doctor-facing <strong>doesn't have to support any version of Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>

        <p>The app is smart and responsive. It's taking advantage of <strong>Backbone.js</strong> to keep pace with doctors' schedules, which are packed, as you might imagine, down to the minute. Our Backbone.js on Rails e-book contains lessons learned directly from this project.</p>

    <h2>Iora Health</h2>

    <p>Iora is for real. The <strong>CEO is an MD</strong>. They have actual lives they're responsible for keeping healthy. If you joined as a web developer for Iora, <strong>you'll work directly with doctors</strong> on a weekly basis to make sure the applications you're building for them are directly impacting the quality of care delivered to Iora's patients.</p>

    <p>They have big ambitions to build a new model of primary health care delivery from the ground up. They want to ensure radically improved customer service, better health outcomes, and dramatically lower overall health care costs.</p>

    <p>The Iora model of health care changes everything â€“ payment, staffing, processes, IT systems, and culture. The have <strong>no status quo to defend, no arcane rules to follow</strong>. They are approaching a very big problem in a very smart way and we think they have the know-how to create something special.</p>

    <p>They are based in the Cambridge Innovation Center, right off the <strong>Kendall Square</strong> Red Line T stop in <strong>Cambridge, MA</strong>.</p>
