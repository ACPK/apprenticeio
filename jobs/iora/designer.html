    <h2>Web Designer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>We (thoughtbot) have been working with Iora for the past few months and the engagement ends in September. We're big fans of this company and the people who work there.</p>

        <p>We happily recommend them to fellow web designers and strongly encourage you to apply.</p>

        <p>As a member of their full-time, six-person design and development team, you'll <strong>work with developers who are passionate</strong> about ensuring the delivery of high quality software using best practices. This is a test-driven development, Cucumber-and-RSpec, "CI is green" kind of team.</p>

        <p>You'll be taking over a highly factored HTML5 and CSS3 codebase that uses [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) for super-DRY CSS.</p>

        <p>The app is inherently mobile. It's <strong>designed for the iPad</strong>, with a doctor's touch in mind. Forget about IE6. Anything doctor-facing <strong>doesn't have to support any version of Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>

        <p>The app is smart and responsive. It's taking advantage of <strong>Backbone.js</strong> to keep pace with doctors' schedules, which are packed, as you might imagine, down to the minute. Our Backbone.js on Rails e-book contains lessons learned directly from this project.</p>

    <h2>Iora Health</h2>

    <p>Iora is for real. The <strong>CEO is an MD</strong>. They have actual lives they're responsible for keeping healthy. If you joined as a web developer for Iora, <strong>you'll work directly with doctors</strong> on a weekly basis to make sure the applications you're building for them are directly impacting the quality of care delivered to Iora's patients.</p>

    <p>They have big ambitions to build a new model of primary health care delivery from the ground up. They want to ensure radically improved customer service, better health outcomes, and dramatically lower overall health care costs.</p>

    <p>The Iora model of health care changes everything â€“ payment, staffing, processes, IT systems, and culture. The have <strong>no status quo to defend, no arcane rules to follow</strong>. They are approaching a very big problem in a very smart way and we think they have the know-how to create something special.</p>

    <p>They are based in the Cambridge Innovation Center, right off the <strong>Kendall Square</strong> Red Line T stop in <strong>Cambridge, MA</strong>.</p>
