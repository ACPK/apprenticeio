              &quot;thoughtbot is the best in the industry as far as Ruby on 
              Rails programming/developers. We're very pleased with the 
              product they created for us and would recommend them to anyone 
              looking to build a web application in Ruby.&quot;

              &quot;We hired thoughtbot to bring our web start-up idea to 
              life. 8 months later we were chosen by Time Magazine as a 
              Best Website of the Year. &quot;

              &quot;We hired thoughtbot initially to build the prototype for 
              our new advertising platform, called Shortbord. Based on the 
              reference checks we conducted prior to hiring thoughtbot, we were 
              confident they were technically strong and would execute on our 
              business vision. I feel confident recommending thoughtbot to any 
              start-up looking to get off the ground, or any company looking to 
              rework their web presence.&quot;
