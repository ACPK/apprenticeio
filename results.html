    <h2>Thanks for filling out our Project Planning Form.  We'll be in touch soon to discuss your project further.</h2>
    <p>If you haven't yet, you might want to read through our <a href="http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/">client playbook</a> to get a feel for how we like to work.</p>
    <p>If you believe that we will need a Non-disclosure agreement in place prior to an initial call, you can <a href="/nda/">download and complete our mutual NDA</a> and email it back to <a href="mailto:info@thoughtbot.com">info@thoughtbot.com</a> when you are done.</p>
