      <h6>We believe that the development team should work directly with project stakeholders.</h6>
      <p>Therefore we do not employe salespeople or project managers, both of whom we believe get in the way of actually building successful software. Instead, we employ only senior level developers and designers who are capable of working together to build something successful.</p>

      <h6>We believe in sustainable development.</h6>
      <p>Therefore, we enforce a 40 hour work week, give 3 weeks of paid time off to start, and let people manage their own flexible schedules.</p>

      <h6>We donâ€™t want to be big.</h6>
      <p>We intentionally remain a small, cohesive company. We plan on staying around a ~20 person headcount, and breaking those people up into 4-5 internal teams. Each team works on only one client project at a time.</p>

      <h6>We provide a groundwork for people to make their own success, and encourage people to do so.</h6>
      <p>Everyone has the flexibility to propose new projects, extractions, and products and then see them through to completion. We have an advancement and compensation structure that rewards people who take the initiative and make themselves successful.</p>
