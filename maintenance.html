    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>For years, we've had a policy of not doing "maintenance work" for clients.  We found it too hard to schedule a trickle of hours here and there, and wanted to avoid the overhead of managing many clients across our relatively small team.  We found it easier to focus on 4-6 core clients at a time, with teams of 2-4 people on each client.  For better or worse, this prevented us from starting some relationships and continuing others.  We've sometimes wanted to work on a project, but passed on it because of our own policy.</p>
    
    <h3>The concept</h3>
    <p>We have a larger organization and a better managed schedule now, and have created a team who are specifically allocated to handle things like small application changes, bug fixes, best practice enforcement, security upgrades, etc.  This group is also able to provide ongoing consultative development support and best practice advice to our clients (and potentially to their own technical teams).</p>
    <p>We believe this approach will provide great value for:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 42px;">
      <li>Our "normal" consulting clients, whose engagements can now extend further than previously possible.</li>
      <li>Internal development groups who need a hand keeping their products running and up to date.</li>
      <li>Teams that want to gain some confidence in their own direction by bringing in an outside opinion.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The cost for this is $5,000/month for 25 hours of our time or $10,000/month for 50 hours.  If you don't use the time for a month, you lose it &mdash; but if you need the time, you can be assured that it's there.  Our hope is that smaller minimum time commitment (our previous smallest possible commitment was roughly $30,000/month) will make it possible for us to work on projects that we couldn't before, where controlling the rate of spending is more important than the overall budget or a short term burst of effort.</p>
