    <p>For years, we've had a policy of not doing "maintenance work" for clients.  We found it too hard to schedule a trickle of hours here and there, and wanted to avoid the overhead of managing many clients for our relatively small team.  We found it easier to focus on 4-6 core clients at a time, with teams of 2-4 people on each client.  Unfortunately, this has prevented us from starting and continuing some client relationships where we'd like to have worked on a project but didn't because of this policy.</p>

    <p>We've changed our minds, and now have a team who are specifically allocated to handle things like small application tweaks, bug fixes, security upgrades, etc -- and who are also able to provide more consultative development support and best practice advice to our clients.</p>

    <p>The cost for this is $5,000/month for 25 hours of our time or $10,000/month for 50 hours.  If you don't use the time for a month, you lose it -- but if you need the time, you can be assured that we'll have it for you.  Our hope is that smaller minimum time commitment (our previous smallest possible commitment was roughly $30k/month) will make it possible for us to work on projects that we couldn't before, and provide an engagement which burns through budgets less quickly than a full time team commitment does -- while still providing considerable value through both the actual development services and the consultative portion as well.</p>
