    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>We (thoughtbot) have been writing code with America's Test Kitchen since late spring.</p>

        <p>We helped them set up a performant production environment for the launch of their online cooking school. We taught them Test-Driven Development, developed a <strong>Cucumber, Capybara Webkit, and RSpec</strong> test suite, and learned how much they care about quality cooking content.</p>

        <p>We happily recommend them to fellow web developers and strongly encourage you to apply.</p>

        <p>The Test Kitchen School <strong>Rails 3</strong> application is deployed to Heroku. It uses <strong>Backbone.js</strong> heavily to make the cooking lessons responsive and Sass for more enjoyable CSS authoring. If you're interested in those technologies, but not necessarily an expert, you should apply.</p>

        <p>The core content offering is <strong>high definition streaming video</strong> of expert cooks teaching home learners knife skills, skillet cooking, Italian cooking, and other interesting techniques.</p>

        <p>As a developer joining this team, you'll be writing code to prove an online cooking school can be successful. You'll find ways to better convert visitors into paying customers and spread high-quality cooking knowledge to a global audience.</p>

    <h2>America's Test Kitchen</h2>

    <p>America's Test Kitchen is a fully equipped test kitchen located in a beautiful brick building right next to the <strong>Brookline Village</strong> Green Line T stop in <strong>Brookline, MA</strong>.</p>

    <p>Testing is so important to the culture it's in the company name.</p>

    <p>They do side-by-side comparisons, <strong>blind taste tests</strong>, and rigorous equipment performance tests to determine which pans cook the best food, which brand of ketchup tastes best, how long to good pasta in order to get the right amount of sauce to stick to it, etc.</p>

    <p>They publish two popular magazines (Cook's Illustrated and Cook's Country) and a line of popular cookbooks. They also produce a popular television series.</p>

    <p>As a result, they have <strong>a large audience</strong> they can cross-sell to the new online cooking school. Unlike other startups, they'll have no problem getting people to notice your work.</p>
