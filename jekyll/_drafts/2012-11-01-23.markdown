description: "Ben Orenstein is joined by Tammer Saleh and Randall Thomas, the founders of Thunderbolt Labs. They discuss their philosophy for running and building the company, how they differ from other consulting companies, and how they do much more than just Rails programming and how its leading to very interesting new kinds of work. Why they list their prices right on their website, and how they derived their rate of $277 per hour. They also explore what their first year in business has been like, some challenges they've faced, and some important lessons they've learned."
