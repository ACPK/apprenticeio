    <p>Fanboat, the iPhone app from Stattleship, becomes a personal sports guide. It displays a list of feats preformed by athletes based on user own teams preferences. It also suggests new players, teams and stats based on how rare or popular the feat is.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Stattleship re-approached us to help them to continue to build off the success of the game that we initially helped them develop. They were looking for a companion app to work alongside the game that we had developed to show sports fans interesting stats from teams and players that they were interested in. They wanted a way to make stats fun, interesting and support the learning of a sports fan. Also, Stattleship needed to figure out how this app would factor into the already established game that they had.</p>

      <section class="solution">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>To start, Stattleship built an email system that replicated the main feature of the app. This let us to quickly and easily discover how interesting the product could be, what stats users could be interested in and what the user might be looking for for additional information. Using this information we were able to design and build the app to give the user the right amount and type of stats.</p>
