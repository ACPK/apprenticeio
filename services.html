            <h6>Web Design &amp; Development</h6>
            <p>We are a full-service, never-subcontract <a href="/team">team</a> of 13 web developers and 5 web designers. We have focused only on Ruby on Rails web applications since before Rails 1.0 was released in 2005.</p>
            <p>Our process is to design the user interface first, then implement <a href="http://handbook.thoughtbot.com/before-thoughtbot/#user_stories">user stories</a>. We work in weekly iterations and deploy to production often. We believe our process maximumizes product quality and flexibility of scope right up until launch.</p>

            <h6>Kick Start</h6>
            <p>We provide an extra service called "Kick Start" for startups who want it. We interview and make recommendations on candidates for the company's first full-time designers or developers (often the CTO). This is often a challenge for non-technical founders and we're happy to help. We know many people in the community and have interviewed countless people over the years.</p>

            <p><a href="http://hoptoadapp.com">Hoptoad</a> &mdash; the original &ldquo;app error app&rdquo; &mdash; is a software as service (SaaS) web application we wrote to solve a common problem we had while developing apps for clients. The service collects errors generated by web apps, and aggregates the results. It has helped thousands of developers at companies like Kickstarter, Gowalla, and Localytics fix millions of errors.</p>
