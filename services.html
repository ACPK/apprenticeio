            <h6>Web Design &amp; Development</h6>
            <p>We are a full-service, never-subcontract <a href="/about">team</a> of 11 web developers, 5 web designers, and 1 energetic assistant. We have focused only on Ruby on Rails web applications since before Rails 1.0 was released in 2005.</p>
            <p>Our process is to design the user interface first, then implement <a href="http://handbook.thoughtbot.com/before-thoughtbot/#user_stories">user stories</a>. We work in weekly iterations and deploy to production often. We believe our process maximumizes product quality and flexibility of scope right up until launch.</p>

            <h6>Workshops</h6>
            <p>We have an advantage in our consulting business of working on many web apps. We share what we've learned in our workshops, where we've trained hundreds of designers and developers from Harvard University, The New York Times, Raytheon, Mitre and more.</p>
            <p>To learn more, email our workshop team at <a href="mailto:workshops@thoughtbot.com">workshops@thoughtbot.com</a>.</p>

          <div id="services-kick-start" class="services-section clearfix">
            <h6>Kick Start</h6>
            <p>We provide an extra service called "Kick Start" for startups who want it. We interview and make recommendations on candidates for the company's first full-time designers or developers (often the CTO). This is often a challenge for non-technical founders and we're happy to help. We know many people in the community and have interviewed countless people over the years.</p>
            <p>Typically, a kick start engagement will occur after a normal design and development engagement for a client, but we are open to doing placement only for the right businesses.</p>
