        <p class="passion">We believe the best learning occurs during hands-on, intimate time with passionate experts. Our workshops never have more than a 5-to-1 student-teacher ratio. They are short lectures followed by long pair programming sessions where students develop a real Rails app.</p>

        Having taken a Thoughtbot training class on my own dime I can say itâ€™s 110% worth it. If you can hook it up, do it.
