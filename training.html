    <h2><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> Training</h2>
    <h3>Ruby is the preferred programming language on the web. Experienced Rubyists move quickly from idea to live app running short, beautiful code. thoughtbot's developers work every day in that environment and we're pleased to bring our battle scars to our training workshops.</h3>

        <p class="passion">We believe the best learning occurs during hands-on, intimate time with passionate experts. Our workshops never have more than a 5-to-1 student-teacher ratio. They are short lectures followed by long pair programming sessions where students develop a real Rails app.</p>
